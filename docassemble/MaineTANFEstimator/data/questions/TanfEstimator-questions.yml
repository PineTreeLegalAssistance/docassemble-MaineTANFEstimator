  Welcome to PTLA's **Maine TANF Benefits Estimator** where you can estimate monthly TANF benefits for Maine households. 

  We have tried to make this tool easy to understand - but eligibilty for TANF can be complicated. We cannot guarantee the result you get from this calculator will be the amount of TANF benefits you receive, if you are eligible. But it can help you understand how those calculations work, and get an idea of what TANF benefits you may be eligible for.
