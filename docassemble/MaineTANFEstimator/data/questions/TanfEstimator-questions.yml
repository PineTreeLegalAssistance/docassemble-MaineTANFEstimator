  **<span>[${as_of_date}]</span>**
  
  Welcome to PTLA's **Maine TANF Benefits Estimator** where you can estimate monthly TANF benefits for Maine households thinking about applying for TANF. 

  We have tried to make this tool easy to understand - but eligibilty for TANF can be complicated. We cannot guarantee the result from this calculator will be the amount of TANF benefits you get, if you are eligible. But it can help you understand how those calculations work, and get an idea of what TANF benefits you may be eligible for. 
  
  TANF eligibility involves a calculation of your: 
  <ul>
  <li>Household size</li>
  <li>Income</li>
  <li>Certain expenses like shelter</li>
  </ul>

  This calculator asks questions about these factors to estimate your monthly TANF benefits.  
  <br />
  It should take less than 5 minutes to complete.
