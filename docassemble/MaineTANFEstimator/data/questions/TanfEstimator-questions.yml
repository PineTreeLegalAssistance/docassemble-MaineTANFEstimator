  Welcome to PTLA's **Maine TANF Benefits Estimator** where you can estimate monthly TANF benefits for Maine households. 

  We have tried to make this tool easy to understand - but eligibilty for TANF can be complicated. We cannot guarantee the result you get from this calculator will be the amount of TANF benefits you receive, if you are eligible. But it can help you understand how those calculations work, and get an idea of what TANF benefits you may be eligible for.

fields:
  - Adults in the household: HHAdults
    datatype: integer
  - note: |
      The adults who can receive TANF on behalf of a child(ren) must be living in the same home and caring for the child(ren); they can include biological, legal, adoptive, and step-parents, siblings and half-siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and first cousins. Do not count any adults who get SSI. It is ok if the number of adults in the household is '0' here - children in the household may still get child-only TANF benefits.
  - Children in the household: HHChildren

  - note: |
      Children must be under the age of 18 or be ages 18-20 and enrolled as a full-time high school student working towards a high school diploma. Do not count any children who get SSI.
